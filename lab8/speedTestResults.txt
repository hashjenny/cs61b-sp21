----------------Buckets Speed Test------------------------
This program inserts random Strings of length L
Into different types of maps as <String, Integer> pairs.
What would you like L to be?: 100
Enter # strings to insert into each map: 10000
class hashmap.MyHashMapALBuckets: 1.36 sec
class hashmap.MyHashMapLLBuckets: 1.41 sec
class hashmap.MyHashMapTSBuckets: 1.39 sec
class hashmap.MyHashMapHSBuckets: 1.41 sec
class hashmap.MyHashMapPQBuckets: 1.40 sec

--------------Insert In Order Speed Test-----------------
This program inserts lexicographically increasing Stringsinto Maps as <String, Integer> pairs.

Enter # strings to insert into hashmap.ULLMap: 30000
class hashmap.ULLMap: 2.30 sec

Enter # strings to insert into hashmap.MyHashMap: 30000
class hashmap.MyHashMap: 1.93 sec

Enter # strings to insert into Java's HashMap: 30000
Java's Built-in HashMap: 0.03 sec
